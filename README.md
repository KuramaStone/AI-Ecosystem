A procedural map is generated for each new world. Lifeforms populate it until they begin to thrive on their own. After that, evolution takes place.

## Features

- **AI Powered**: All lifeforms have their behaviour controlled by a neural network coded using Eigen for math. They are aware of their environment and respond accordingly!
- **Realtime Evolution**: Lifeforms mutate and reproduce, naturally evolving to their environment.
- **Procedural Animation**: Animation of the cells is done through noise and other shader techniques.
- **Erosion Simulation**: Terrain has erosion textures that are created through simulating water currents.
- **Powerful Optimizations**: For this simulation, speed was the primary focus. Thousands of FPS are achievable even on low-end gaming systems. C++ was chosen specifically for its compiler optimizations.
